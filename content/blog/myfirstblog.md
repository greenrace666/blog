HiðŸ‘‹

First of all, welcome to my blog. I'm going to try to write blogs on this website since:

> "Writing blogs â€¦ is cool I guessâ€¦"
> 
> -Shakespeare, 1582 AD

I do not have any particular aim and direction to lead this blog but I guess it will follow these themes:

* Majorly regarding my academic interests and the BTS of academic stuff I do
* Sometimes regarding my opinions as a student upon current affairs and academia
* Sometimes regarding personal and overall development, psychology
* A pinch of weird stuff

If you wish to know more regarding me professionally, visit my website: [nikilkrishna.netlify.app](https://nikilkrishna.netlify.app)

Apart from the above interests, I also sometimes spend time in journalling, travel, drawing. Here is one I made:
